Abstract
The visualization and exploration of large-scale linked data represents a critical challenge for non-expert users, particularly in cultural heritage contexts where the user base does not consistently align with technological practices. This paper presents the Semantic Tree Advanced module, a specialized hierarchical navigation component for ResearchSpace addressing performance and usability limitations in browsing RDF knowledge graphs modeled with RiC-O (Records in Contexts - Ontology) and its extensions. Standard tree visualization components in ResearchSpace employ monolithic query strategies that become computationally impractical for archival collections containing thousands of entities in complex relationship networks. The module implements dynamic SPARQL query generation, progressive data loading, contextual filtering, and persistent state management to enable efficient navigation while maintaining semantic precision. The architecture balances technical sophistication with familiar file-system metaphors, making sophisticated linked data structures accessible to non-technical users. The module has been tested on the Valerio Evangelisti born-digital author archive, modeled using BoDi (Born-Digital Archival Description Ontology) - an extension of RiC-O - comprising approximately 60 million triples, a scale at which rationalizing access becomes essential.

Introduction
The Semantic Web introduced formal standards for representing, linking, and querying structured information across distributed environments through machine-readable, interoperable formats (Berners-Lee, Hendler & Lassila 2001). Within this framework, Linked Open Data (LOD) technologies employ the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and ontological vocabularies to encode explicit, typed relationships between entities, enabling graph-based representations that support flexible datasets integrations (Klyne & Carroll 2004; Allemang & Hendler 2011).
These capabilities are particularly significant for cultural heritage institutions, where materials are embedded in inherently complex contextual networks. Archives, libraries, and museums have increasingly adopted LOD to interconnect materials across institutional boundaries and to model contextual features such as intellectual lineages, correspondence networks, documentation of professional exchanges, and the temporal evolution of artifacts through version histories and format migrations (Bizer, Heath & Berners-Lee 2009; Isaac & Summers 2014). Knowledge graphs grounded in LOD principles can represent these multidimensional relationships using RDF triples, facilitating discovery pathways that emerge from semantic associations rather than from fixed hierarchical or organizational structures.
Despite these advantages, a critical tension persists between the technical sophistication of Semantic Web technologies and their practical accessibility. The expressive power of LOD frequently imposes substantial cognitive and technical demands on users, who must understand SPARQL querying, graph structures, and ontology-driven data modeling to fully exploit its potential. The primary user communities of cultural heritage institutions – including historians, literary scholars, students, and members of the general public – rarely possess such expertise, resulting in significant barriers to exploration and interpretation (Hyvönen 2012; Binder et al. 2020). This accessibility gap undermines the democratic ideals of open data: when only technically trained specialists can navigate linked datasets, the promise of openness becomes effectively constrained.
The challenge becomes more pronounced at scale. Small experimental knowledge graphs containing hundreds or thousands of triples can be navigated through basic browsing interfaces or simple visualization tools. However, contemporary cultural-heritage LOD initiatives increasingly operate at the scale of millions of triples, encompassing thousands of interlinked entities within deep hierarchical and relational structures. At such scales, conventional navigation metaphors break down: visualizations become congested and unreadable, and the semantic richness that makes LOD valuable simultaneously becomes a barrier to meaningful user interaction (Dadzie & Rowe 2011).
The archive of the Italian writer and activist Valerio Evangelisti (1952-2022) exemplifies these challenges. This hybrid archive documents over four decades of activity, with its most substantial component consisting of born-digital materials: 389 floppy disks and three hard drives totaling approximately 2.1 TB, spanning from 1995 to 2022. This digital partition documents Evangelisti's continuous experimentation with computing technologies since the 1980s, preserving working folders for novels organized by chapters, study collections, email backups from multiple accounts, software and videogame collections, and extensive system files that situate creative production within specific technical environments. The archive's complexity extends beyond volume to encompass multiple simultaneous contextual dimensions: individual items relate to political networks, academic production, literary creation across multiple draft versions and publisher correspondence, and technological evolution through format migrations from floppy disks to contemporary storage media. Complementing this digital core are analog materials: five document boxes preserved at the Marco Pezzi Archive containing essays, political pamphlets and press clippings; thirty-seven photo albums; sixteen notebooks with manuscript drafts; Super 8 reels, and approximately 6,000 volumes kept by the library of the Classical Philology and Italian studies of the University of Bologna, overall capturing Evangelisti's intersecting roles as activist, historian of Emilia-Romagna social history, and internationally recognized author.
The semantic modeling of the digital partition of Evangelisti's archive produced a knowledge graph exceeding 6 million RDF triples modeled through the Born-Digital Ontology (BoDi), an extension of the Records in Contexts - Ontology (RiC-O). This scale reflects the representational density required to capture how files simultaneously participate in chronological sequences, thematic clusters, and production workflows, with the file system of the main hard drive reaching up to 18 levels of hierarchical depth. While this semantic richness enables granular search capabilities and supports both close reading of individual files and distant reading patterns across the collection, it intensifies the accessibility challenge: navigating 6 million triples demands knowledge of SPARQL querying, comprehension of the underlying ontological model, and familiarity with the archive's structure and contents. The Evangelisti case thus crystallizes the central problematic of rendering large-scale LOD representations cognitively and practically accessible to users lacking specialized training in semantic technologies.

Exploring triples through ResearchSpace
In the digital ecosystem, archival description concerns not only the representation of contents but also the ways in which researchers access, explore, and interpret data (Langdon 2016). Description offers the possibility of mediating between the knowledge graph and research practices, translating relational complexity into forms of access that are comprehensible and navigable for non-specialist users. The challenge lies in rendering graphs comprehensible through familiar interfaces and visualizations without losing conceptual coherence and semantic granularity. Addressing accessibility challenges in large-scale linked data requires platforms capable of enabling publication, exploration, and querying of RDF data while bridging the gap between semantic sophistication and user accessibility through SPARQL endpoints and dedicated visualization interfaces.
ResearchSpace is an open-source platform for managing, exploring, and publishing cultural heritage knowledge graphs. Developed at the British Museum with support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and in partnership with Metaphacts, it aims “to help establish a community of researchers, where their underlying activities are framed by data sharing, active engagement in formal arguments, and semantic publishing” (Oldman & Tanase 2018, 325). Since 2023, ResearchSpace has been maintained by Kartography CIC, a non-profit Community Interest Company, with collaborative development through a public GitHub repository enabling community participation in the platform's evolution.
The platform’s architecture is based on Semantic Web technologies, using RDF for data representation and SPARQL as the query language. ResearchSpace proposes a conception of knowledge graphs understood as “a continually changing informational structure that mediates between a human, the world and a computer. The graph itself is ontologically based and enhanced by human epistemology” (Oldman & Tanase 2018, 330).
The system is structured in integrable and configurable modules (templates), each offering specialized functionalities that can be adapted to individual project needs, allowing the combination of analysis, visualization, and curation tools in a customizable environment. Each template is built around one or more SPARQL queries that retrieve data for the visualization, which can be defined and modified according to project objectives. Above this query layer, the template specifies the presentation modalities for the extracted data, enabling extensive customization both functionally (in the logic of visualization and interaction objectives) and graphically. Among these, Semantic Search and Semantic Forms enable context-based and faceted searches; Knowledge Patterns provide reusable ontological schemas for adding, retrieving, or modifying complex relationships between entities, while Knowledge Maps allow visualization of network connections between actors, places, events, objects, and concepts. Other advanced modules include the Image Viewer for comparing and annotating high-resolution images; Semantic Narratives, which combine text, visualizations, tables, and knowledge maps that automatically update as data changes; dynamic timelines useful for visualizing temporal events and dataset contents; and geographic data with OpenStreetMap (Kartography CIC 2023). Templates are configurable according to project needs, and the platform also enables creation of entirely new modules designed specifically to address specific research objectives. Once developed and tested, such modules can be shared with the ResearchSpace community, enabling reuse and adaptation to different contexts.
ResearchSpace has been employed in multiple research, conservation, and cultural heritage management contexts, demonstrating flexibility in adapting to heterogeneous domains. The platform has been adopted by cultural networks and consortia such as LINCS and Pharos, facilitating collaboration among international institutions in sharing information about objects, images, and metadata. In the archaeological and historical sector, projects like Amara West and Deir el-Medina have leveraged ResearchSpace to transform excavation databases into semantic research environments where spatial, material, and ethnographic data are correlated and queried in integrated ways. Regarding museum collections, institutions including the British Museum and the National Archives UK have utilized the platform to manage conservation, provenance, and research data (The National Archives 2021). In artistic and bibliographic domains, ResearchSpace has supported projects including Late Hokusai, Hokusai: The Great Picture Book of Everything, Sphaera, and the correspondence of Belle da Costa Greene with Bernard Berenson curated by Villa I Tatti, as well as initiatives like VeNiss, RePIM - Repertorio della Poesia Italiana in Musica, 1500-1700, and Florentia Illustrata (Andreose 2025), where historical and geographic data have been modeled for comparative analyses and territorial visualizations. Collectively, these examples demonstrate how the platform enables management of complex knowledge graphs, creation of collaborative environments, and accessibility of complex data through intuitive interfaces, promoting a multidisciplinary and participatory approach to digital research in cultural heritage.
ResearchSpace was developed and tested adopting CIDOC CRM as the reference ontological framework for data modeling. This event-based ontology, originally conceived for the museum domain, was chosen because it enables expression of a high degree of semantic granularity and structuring of information within complex relational contexts. CIDOC CRM provides a model capable of integrating heterogeneous and variable data while preserving their specificity (Oldman & Tanase 2018, 327, 333). Recently, the platform has been adopted for testing by the Digital Humanities Advanced Research Centre (/DH.ARC) of the University of Bologna for the management of cultural heritage data projects. The Valerio Evangelisti Archive case study represented a concrete opportunity to test the platform's flexibility beyond its established museum-oriented applications and CIDOC CRM implementations. The project enabled experimentation with the first ResearchSpace implementation based on an archival ontology, specifically BoDi as an extension of RiC-O, effectively allowing evaluation of the platform’s capacity to support archival ontological frameworks and verification of its compatibility with ontological models other than CIDOC CRM, for which the system was originally designed. This implementation allows active participation in platform experimentation while simultaneously evaluating its effectiveness with respect to archival data representation and access objectives at the scale of millions of triples.

The Semantic Tree Advanced Component
The interface for accessing data from the digital partition of the Valerio Evangelisti Archive in ResearchSpace was designed as an initial experiment to translate the conceptual model’s requirements into operational navigation tools while addressing the performance and usability challenges inherent in large-scale archival knowledge graphs. The adopted hierarchical structure mirrors file system organization, employing this metaphor as a representational tool for born-digital materials while enabling representation of the five conceptual requirements: representation of digital materials in their physical, logical, and content-based components; documentation of file integrity; valorization and preservation of native metadata; traceability of processual and curatorial provenance; and restitution of multiple contexts, both hierarchical and transversal. 
From a methodological standpoint, the essential element resides in adopting the file system as a representational metaphor for born-digital archival materials; a choice that reflects not merely an interface convention but the authentic organizational structure through which materials were originally created, managed, and accumulated in their digital environment. This choice provided the foundation for defining a reference structure that makes the internal organization of digital contents comprehensible and accessible. The file system metaphor offers advantages in archival contexts: it represents the most canonical visualization form for archival materials, the interface paradigm to which users are accustomed, and provides immediate cognitive accessibility by leveraging existing mental models of hierarchical organization. Beyond preserving the original organizational logic, the objective was to propose an expandable tree visualization capable of exposing the complexity of underlying semantic relationships while supporting exploration pathways that transcend the purely vertical dimension. This approach combines the familiarity of traditional hierarchical structures with the epistemic potential offered by semantic technologies, enabling users to navigate simultaneously along hierarchical axes (following the file system organization) and through horizontal semantic connections that traverse and interconnect different branches of the archival structure, revealing relationships that may not be apparent in the physical arrangement alone.
Within the ResearchSpace ecosystem, the Semantic Tree module constitutes the predefined tool for representing hierarchical relationships among RDF entities. Its operation is based on one or more SPARQL queries that retrieve the set of resources and their relationships, constructing a tree structure in which each node corresponds to an entity in the graph and the branches represent relationships of belonging or logical dependency among them. The basic Semantic Tree offers static visualization: a single initial query retrieves the entire relationship graph, which is then made available to users through expansion and compression functions for individual nodes. While effective for datasets of limited size or ontologies with restricted depth, this approach presents critical performance limitations when applied to archival structures of great complexity or extension. In the case of the Evangelisti Archive, with its file system reaching 18 levels of hierarchical depth and encompassing thousands of entities across 6 million triples, the monolithic query strategy proved computationally untenable: initial loading times became prohibitive, memory consumption exceeded reasonable thresholds, and the system's responsiveness deteriorated significantly. Moreover, the basic configuration does not efficiently manage scenarios in which the tree must be dynamically reconstructed according to search or filtering criteria: every modification of the view requires complete reloading of the hierarchy, with consequent loss of navigation context and node expansion state.
To address these structural requirements and adapt the tool to the complexity and scale exemplified by the Evangelisti collection, an extended version of the module was developed, designated Semantic Tree Advanced. The architectural redesign focused on four principal technical objectives: (1) optimizing query performance through progressive data loading, (2) maintaining semantic precision while reducing computational overhead, (3) preserving navigation state across dynamic view modifications, and (4) extending hierarchical navigation through integrated search functionality and transversal relationship traversal. This comprehensive approach aimed to transform the basic tree visualization into an interactive exploration environment capable of supporting both vertical navigation along the file system hierarchy and horizontal discovery of semantic connections across the archival structure.
The principal innovation consists of progressive and contextual data loading through dynamic SPARQL query generation. Instead of retrieving the entire relationship graph in a single query, only the root and first descendant level are displayed at initialization. When users decide to expand a node, the system generates and executes a targeted SPARQL query to retrieve specifically its child nodes, implementing an asynchronous and progressive loading mechanism. Each subtree is thus generated exclusively in response to user interaction, with queries constructed dynamically based on the selected node's IRI and the underlying ontological structure. This approach fundamentally transforms the performance profile: initial load times are reduced to retrieval of only the top-level nodes, memory consumption remains bounded regardless of total dataset size, and query execution times scale with the number of children per node rather than with the entire collection. The architecture implements persistent state management, maintaining node expansion status across filtering and search operations without requiring complete tree reconstruction. Selection of a single tree element provides access to a detailed resource view displaying associated descriptive information and complete metadata through additional targeted queries.
Parallel to progressive data loading, the Semantic Tree Advanced introduces an integrated contextual search function that operates directly on the tree structure while maintaining performance at scale. Unlike traditional searches that return a result list separate from the structure, this search filters and reorganizes the hierarchy itself through dynamic query generation. When users insert a term in the search bar, the system constructs a SPARQL query that: (1) identifies nodes matching the search criteria; (2) retrieves the complete hierarchical path from root to each matching node; (3) reconstructs the tree displaying only relevant branches while preserving structural context. The implementation employs query optimization techniques including path traversal strategies and selective property matching to maintain responsiveness even when searching across millions of triples. Visualization thus preserves the archive's original hierarchy and enables continuous consultation in which results are highlighted directly in the view without modifying the overall navigation logic or requiring complete data reloading.
The module also integrates a system of reversible and combinable filters designed to modulate the quantity and typology of displayed tree nodes through query-level exclusion rather than post-retrieval filtering. Filters modify the SPARQL query patterns themselves, ensuring that excluded nodes are never retrieved from the database, thereby maintaining performance consistency regardless of filter application. In the Evangelisti project, filters were implemented to exclude materials anonymized for privacy reasons, with the system dynamically adjusting queries to omit these nodes while preserving descendant counts and structural integrity information necessary for navigation context.
The module implements dynamic sorting functionality enabling reorganization of node visualization according to user-defined criteria (e.g. title, creation date, IRI, number of descendant elements) with the operation applied recursively through query-level ORDER BY clauses. This approach ensures that sorting occurs during data retrieval rather than through post-processing, maintaining responsiveness at scale.
Finally, the “related nodes” system represents a significant extension enabling transcendence of strictly hierarchical navigation constraints through horizontal exploration pathways. Each correlation criterion (such as elements with the same creation date, created with the same software, possessing the same hash code, or connected to the same literary work) is associated with a dynamically generated SPARQL query that utilizes the selected node's IRI as a parameter. The system interrogates the database to identify semantically connected entities and highlights them within their context (i.e. the existing tree view) without requiring tree reconstruction. This functionality proves essential for valorizing the richness of the underlying semantic model: while hierarchical visualization reflects the physical-logical ordering of the collection, transversal connections restore the complexity of thematic, temporal, or contextual relationships that bind documents among themselves. The implementation balances expressiveness with performance through selective property traversal and result limiting strategies appropriate to interactive exploration contexts.
From the informational structure perspective, the tree identifies at the highest level a general grouping of born-digital materials, functioning as a container for the three principal documented support typologies: contents of the main computer utilized by Evangelisti, those of the external hard drive, and transfers of materials preserved on floppy disks. Each of these three groupings replicates the organization of relative supports according to the file system configuration as received. Expanding each tree level enables navigation of the various supports' content hierarchy through progressive loading; node selection permits visualization of detailed descriptive information retrieved through targeted queries including: for collection-level groupings, overview information with summary content description, element counts, total dimensions, and chronological extremes alongside archival history documentation; for individual files and folders, preview descriptions, integrity information (hash codes and calculation provenance), complete technical metadata sets, and references to corresponding literary works.
The ensemble of these technical implementations (i.e. progressive loading, dynamic query generation, contextual filtering, persistent state management, and horizontal relationship) configures a consultation environment that addresses the fundamental performance and usability challenges of large-scale archival knowledge graph navigation. The architecture balances technical sophistication with familiar interface metaphors, rendering sophisticated linked data structures accessible while maintaining responsiveness at the scale of millions of triples. The effectiveness of these design choices and their performance characteristics under various operational scenarios constitute the focus of the following evaluation.
